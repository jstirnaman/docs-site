_Send the Docs!_ is where I experiment with _docs-as-code_ workflows, tooling, and automation to build developer-friendly documentation.
Find tools and patterns that you can use to improve your project documentation.

My goals for Send the Docs! include the following:

- Practice writing, programming, generating and managing content with Hugo, automating content pipelines, deploying, and SEO.
- Develop templates that structure and render API endpoint documentation in a user-friendly format.
- Compare free and open-source tools for generating human-friendly documentation from an API specification.
- Experiment with improving and enhancing documentation with features like code samples, live requests, and dynamic themes.
- Provide examples and workflows that you can use for your own documentation.
