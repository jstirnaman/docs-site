Send the Docs! is where I experiment with _docs-as-code_ workflows, tooling, and automation to build developer-friendly documentation.

    About the author
  </h1>
  <div class="offset-2">
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer, technical writer, and librarian.
      I enjoy learning, solving problems, and using technology to improve workflows.
      I fell in love with metadata (for biodiversity sampling) and the Web in the late 1990's.
      After earning my Master's in Library and Information Science and learning HTML and CSS, I worked as a reference librarian and managed
      digital library collections, content repositories, and web sites for Missouri State Government and University of Kansas Medical Center.
      In order to get stuff done, I learned the basics of configuring and managing Apache web server, Tomcat, and Nginx web servers, and using
      monitoring tools to help keep me sane.

    </p>
    <p>
      While attending a conference in 2011, I heard about scrum and agile approaches to software development and projects.
      It just made sense and I fell in love with the practicality, principles, and adaptability.
      Later, I was fortunate to pair with some great developers who taught me the value and practice
      of automating tests.
      I learned CI/CD, DevOps, and how to script tasks that I'd never considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my quest to solve problems and automate tedium, I kept improving as a programmer, primarily with
      Ruby on Rails, and later with JavaScript and React.
      As an engineer, I've worked on:
      <ul>
        <li>
          React, TypeScript, and API integrations to build a platform for tracking marketing leads and filtering prospective clients. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Content management and search using Solr with Drupal and Ruby on Rails.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payments processing using "plain ol'" JavaScript, jQuery, Java, and Oracle.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When I considered leaving the public sector and joining the for-profit world, I feared that I wasn't
      "good enough" to be a front-end engineer in a fast-paced, corporate setting.
      As it turned out, I was far ahead in some respects and technology adoption was often
      slower-paced than I'd prefer.
      For everything else, our team relied on each other and figured it out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working as an engineer and technical lead, I found that my technical skills were sufficient, 
      but my superpower was more about helping other developers be successful.
      I was reminded of what I enjoy most:
      <ul>
        <li>Helping people learn.</li>
        <li>Sharing information.</li>
        <li>Writing and editing.</li>
        <li>Automating to improve quality and to free humans up for more creative work.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that I wanted to improve developer experience, and writing was a natural vehicle for me.
      I also knew that I wanted to keep coding, learning, and experimenting with new tools.
      At InfluxData, I found a great team and the perfect mix of writing, automating, and hacking on APIs for developers.
      So, I took the leap into technical writing and they took a risk on me.
      I still have a lot to learn, but it fits.
      Since then I've also volunteered as a technical writer with the Ethereum Foundation, writing guides for the Semaphore protocol and smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not working on docs and code, I'm playing with my family, cooking, cycling, and enjoying music.
