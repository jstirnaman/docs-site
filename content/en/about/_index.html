Send the Docs is where I experiment with Docs-as-code to build developer-friendly documentation.

    About the author
  </h1>
  <div class="offset-2">
    <p>
      I'm a technical writer, documentation engineer, developer, and librarian.
      I fell in love with metadata (for biodiversity sampling) and the Web in the late 1990's.
      After earning my Master's in Library and Information Science, I worked as a reference librarian and managed
      digital library collections, content repositories, and web sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of a hunger to solve problems, a desire to automate tedious tasks, and a passion for information sharing,
      I continued learning agile, programming, and DevOps.
      I've used React, TypeScript, and API integrations to build a lead discovery platform. 
      I've worked on content management and search with Solr, Drupal, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and XSLT.
      I've worked with a large team on a legacy payments processing system using "plain ol'" JavaScript, jQuery, Java, and Oracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was fortunate to pair with some great developers who taught me the value and practice
      of automated tests.
      I learned CI/CD and how to automate processes I'd never considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I considered leaving the public sector for the for-profit world, I feared that I didn't have
      what it took to be a frontend engineer in a fast-paced, corporate world.
      As it turned out, some aspects weren't as fast-paced as I would've liked.
      For everything else, our team relied on each other and figured it out together.
      Working as an engineer and technical lead, I found that my technical skills were sufficient, 
      but my superpower was more about helping other developers be successful.
      I was reminded of what I enjoy most:
      <ul>
        <li>Helping people learn.</li>
        <li>Sharing information.</li>
        <li>Writing and editing.</li>
        <li>Applying automation to improve quality and to free people up for more creative work.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      At InfluxData, I found a great team and the perfect mix of writing, automating, hacking on APIs, and helping developers.
      So, I took the leap into technical writing and they took a risk on me.
      Since then I've also volunteered as a technical writer with the Ethereum Foundation, writing guides for the Semaphore protocol and smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not working on docs and code, I'm playing with my family, cooking, cycling, and enjoying music.
      Don't be surprised if some of those themes trickle in here.
