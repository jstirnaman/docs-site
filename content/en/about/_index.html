Send the Docs is where I experiment with Docs-as-code to build developer-friendly documentation.

    About the author

    <p>
      I'm a technical writer, documentation engineer, and developer.
      I fell in love with metadata (for biodiversity sampling) and the Web in the late 1990's.
      After earning my Master's in Library and Information Science, I managed library systems,
      web sites, and content repositories at Missouri State Library and University of Kansas
      Medical Center.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of a hunger to solve problems, a fear of tedium, and a passion for information sharing,
      I continued learning agile, programming, and DevOps.
      Using Ruby on Rails, Solr, and API integrations, I worked on projects to capture
      showcase medical school faculty expertise and publishing.
      I had the pleasure of learning from and working with great developers who taught me the value and practice
      of automated tests and I learned how to automate processes I'd never considered.
    <p>
      After working as a full-stack engineer, frontend engineer, and technical lead in a number of organizations, I was reminded
      that I enjoy:
      <ul>
        <li>Helping people learn.</li>
        <li>Sharing information.</li>
        <li>Applying automation to improve quality and to free people up for more creative work.</li>
        <li>Writing and editing.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2021, I decided to take a risk on technical writing.
      Thankfully, the InfluxData Docs Team took a risk on me.
      It was a great team and the perfect mix of writing, automating, playing with APIs, and helping developers.
      I also volunteered as a technical writer with the Ethereum Foundation, writing guides for the Semaphore protocol and smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      After InfluxData announced layoffs in November 2022, I started this site as a proving ground for
      ideas that I'd planned to implement there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not spending my time on docs and code, I'm playing with my family, cooking, cycling, or enjoying music.
      Don't be surprised if some of those themes trickle in here.
